Sample project written in Java for learning Selenium WebDriver - how application can interact with browser and Javascript code of the web pages.

This project helps automate some repeated routine tasks of the browser game:
- play minigames (several types) through Javascript-code interaction;
- send pet to the hunt to location that have most benefits;
- get pet's reward;
- buy pet's food (contains algorithm that accounts of budget constraints).

Features:
- navigate through static and dynamic pages (waits until elements loaded or became clickable);
- login with support of proxy-servers;
- ability to use headless browser mode;
- Selenium, Javascript-interaction, xpath-queries;
- stability - application can recover after errors and try again after some delay (in case of internet-connection errors or some unexpected page elements like season-events or spam).
